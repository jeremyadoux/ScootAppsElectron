ScootAppsElectron
==============

### Installation

```
npm install
```
It will also download Electron runtime, and install dependencies for second `package.json` file inside `app` folder.

### Starting the app

```
npm start
```

### Adding npm modules to your app

Remember to add your dependency to `app/package.json` file, so do:
```
cd app
npm install name_of_npm_module --save
```

### Working with modules

Thanks to [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) you can (and should) use ES6 modules for all code in `src` folder. But because ES6 modules still aren't natively supported you can't use it in the `app` folder.

So for file in `src` folder do this:
```js
import myStuff from './my_lib/my_stuff';
```

But in file in `app` folder the same line must look as follows:
```js
var myStuff = require('./my_lib/my_stuff');
```

# Testing

### Unit tests

Using [electron-mocha](https://github.com/jprichardson/electron-mocha) test runner with the [chai](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/) assertion library. To run the tests go with standard:
```
npm test
```
Test task searches for all files in `src` directory which respect pattern `*.spec.js`.

### End to end tests

Using [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test runner and [spectron](http://electron.atom.io/spectron/). Run with command:
```
npm run e2e
```
The task searches for all files in `e2e` directory which respect pattern `*.e2e.js`.

### Code coverage

Using [istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) code coverage tool. Run with command:
```
npm run coverage
```
You can set the reporter(s) by setting `ISTANBUL_REPORTERS` environment variable (defaults to `text-summary` and `html`). The report directory can be set with `ISTANBUL_REPORT_DIR` (defaults to `coverage`).

### Continuous integration

Electron [can be plugged](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/testing-on-headless-ci.md) into CI systems. Here two CIs are preconfigured for you. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) covers testing on OSX and Linux and [App Veyor](https://www.appveyor.com) on Windows.

# Making a release

To package your app into an installer use command:
```
npm run release
```
It will start the packaging process for operating system you are running this command on. Ready for distribution file will be outputted to `dist` directory.

You can create Windows installer only when running on Windows, the same is true for Linux and OSX. So to generate all three installers you need all three operating systems.

All packaging actions are handled by [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder). See docs of this tool if you want to customize something.

**Note:** There are various icons and bitmap files in `resources` directory. Those are used in installers and intended to be replaced by your own graphics.
